[CHRISTINE:] Tarja<br>
In sleep he sang to me - In dreams he came<br>
That voice which calls to me - And speaks my name<br>
And do I dream again - For now I find<br>
The Phantom of the opera is here - Inside my mind<br>
[PHANTOM:]Marco - Sing once again with me <br>
Our strange duet<br>
My power over you - Grows stronger yet<br>
And though you turn from me - To glance behind<br>
The Phantom of the opera is there - Inside your mind<br>
[CHRISTINE:] Tarja - Those who have seen your face Draw back in fear - I am the mask you wear<br>
[PHANTOM:] Marco - It's me they hear<br>
[TOGETHER:] Your spirit and my voice<br>
In one combined <br>
The phantom of the opera is there - <br>
[PHANTOM:]Marco  Inside your mind<br>
[CHRISTINE:] Tarja Inside my mind<br>
[CHRISTINE:] Tarja <br>
Opera- Beware - Phantom of the opera<br>
[PHANTOM:] Marco - In all your fantasies <br>
You always knew - That man and mystery<br>
[CHRISTINE:] Tarja - Were both in you<br>
[TOGETHER:]<br>
And in this labyrinth - Where night is blind<br>
The phantom of the opera is there - <br>
[PHANTOM:] Marco Inside your mind<br>
[CHRISTINE:] Tarja Inside my mind<br>
[PHANTOM:] Marco - Sing my angel of music<br>

amazing... | <i>Reviewer: @Migu3l_oN</i> | <i>2/26/11</i><br>
<br>
this song is... wao... There is no words to describe it... Really I didn't read the book (yet) but I could find it online and I'll start read it... And this song, just for the fact that tarja perfomanced christine, makes it perfect... I can't imagine another band that could sing this song... Nightwish is a great band... <br>
<br>

Nightwish+Phantom of the Opera=Amazing | <i>Reviewer: singwhatyoucan'tsay</i> | <i>5/30/10</i><br>
<br>
This song is beautiful.  I love Nightwish, and I'm a big Phantom of the Opera (POTO) fan.  <br>
<br>
In all your fantasies<br>
You always knew<br>
That man and mystery<br>
Were both in you<br>
<br>
And in this labyrinth<br>
Where night is blind<br>
The phantom of the opera is there/here<br>
Inside your/my mind<br>
<br>
That's my favorite part, but that might be because that part of the song isn't in the version from the 2004 movie...oh heck, I can't pick a favorite part, I love the whole song.<br>
<br>
I suggest that everyone interested in Phantom of the Opera read the book by the same title.  It's by Gaston Leroux, and it is NOTHING like the movie that I mentioned above.<br>
<br>
Back to the song...<br>
<br>
It's enchanting--like everything by Nightwish tends to be--and this song makes me enjoy POTO even more.  Marco as Erik is better than what's-his-name in the movie.  This is a darker, angrier, not-as-romantic version of Erik that fits the book more. <br>
<br>
Here's when the song starts in the book: I think it starts when Christine is walking towards Erik (when he's singing to her through her mirror) she's completely entranced by his voice...I know I would be, lol.<br>
<br>

The perfect piece for this band | <i>Reviewer: Anonymous</i> | <i>5/7/10</i><br>
<br>
*dances* said it perfectly.  It's like this piece was written specifically for this band and for these two singers.  While the Phantom Of the Opera is a timeless opera, when Nightwish performs this piece, it has been done properly - all other attempts pale in comparison.  Tarja leaves no doubt it's an opera despite the heavy guitar and drums, but Marco as the twisted Phantom puts the Nightwish version WAY over the top.<br>
<br>
The first time I heard Nightwish it was on their &quot;Dark Passion Play&quot; album so Anette was the voice of Nightwish to me and I love her voice.  It's SOOOO pure.  I then heard some of the older stuff with Tarja and there was no doubt why some of the older fans felt estranged.  There is no doubt she is &quot;fully operatic&quot; and losing (ejecting) her changed the band, but I felt the band was just as good with Anette - just in a different way.  However, I hope Anette never tries to do this song with Marco.  She will just embarrass herself with Tarja's performance gone before.<br>

OMG!!!!!!!! | <i>Reviewer: banananananananana</i> | <i>3/22/10</i><br>
<br>
Okay. I must say, this makes it on my top 5 songs from them. LOVEIT!!!!!!!!! I love the beggining when it is just Tarja singing and then the whole band begins. It is a great song with Nightwish's ovn twist on it. They mad it wonderful<br>
<br>

inside my mind... | <i>Reviewer: unknownpersonality</i> | <i>10/30/09</i><br>
<br>
I guess you could say that I'm obsessed with The Phantom Of The Opera.  The movie is so amazing...amazing doesn't even begin to describe it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is the song that got me into Nightwish, and they're now one of my favorite bands.<br>
<br>
Too bad you can't find their CD's in America. :(<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
If you really want to understand this song, or any of the songs from the musical, you need to read the book The Phantom Of The Opera by Gaston Leroux.  <br>

A breathtaking dyad | <i>Reviewer: Casca</i> | <i>10/3/09</i><br>
<br>
This was a perfect marriage between some of the most haunting music and lyrics ever written performed by one of the greatest symphonic rock bands of all time. A beautiful marriage of the hardcore thrashing of chugging guitars and metal and the sophisticated, haunting melodies of dark opera.<br>
<br>
A perfect pairing, this is just the sort of etheral, dark poetry that Tuomas might have composed or written himself!<br>
<br>
LONG LIVE NIGHTWISH, TARJA OR ANETTE<br>
*dances*<br>

^.^ | <i>Reviewer: Natts</i> | <i>6/7/09</i><br>
<br>
MMMMM. I adore Nightwish. I am obsessed with Phantom of the Opera. What a wonderful combination this is! I LOVE Marco's voice as the Phantom. It really really fits. I like it more than the actor who was the Phantom when I got to see it live. So Yay! <br>
<br>
<hr size=1><br>
love this story | <i>Reviewer: th phantom</i> | <i>5/22/09</i><br>
<br>
I love this song as well as other like<br>
the phantom opera ghost by iced earth and &quot;phantom of the opera&quot; by iron maiden, just to mention some. <br>
All these lyrics adapted into a so cool song, its just great.<br>
<br>
<hr size=1><br>
I love it! | <i>Reviewer: Chris</i> | <i>11/20/07</i><br>
<br>
I just love this song ! Marco's voice is so perfect... and i love the way that Tarja sings.<br>
Marco's voice is so special, he have something that make my skin chills<br>
<br>
<hr size=1><br>
Wonderful! | <i>Reviewer: silverwolf</i> | <i>10/24/07</i><br>
<br>
This song is so great it got me interested in the original musical. After reading up on the plotline, I love the song even more. An excellent interpretation by nightwish.<br>
<br>
Marco's voice has just the right gravel to give a modern version, that is ear catchingly diferent from any opera version of the song. His voice gives the impression of a hated, yet pitied figure and allows you to feel empathy for the twisted soul being described.<br>
