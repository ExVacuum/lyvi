Wine, women, and song
I tried them all, it did not take me long
To figure I’d unlocked the door to happiness
I figured wrong with a capital R
All the baggage I brought wouldn’t fit in a mid-size car
That’s why I’m walking on eggshells down the Via Dolorosa
Hasn’t got me any closer so far
Shacked up with a poet, no it wasn’t my department
Now I study the poetry of the studio apartment
Changing the catbox and baking the bread
I should have been paying the bills instead
Of paying homage to an image drawn from somebody else’s head

Song, women, and wine
You can’t fool all the people all the time
But if you’re trying, if you’re looking, if you’re lucky
You can always fool a few and feel fine
Is the line between shame and dread
One grips the lungs, one brains the head
But either one can crush you
Anyone can crush you

Once I dated an actor, she was working on a play
By opening night, we had nothing left to say to each other
We hit the wall, it was not resilient
She said that she was hungrier than I was brilliant
And who the hell was I to disagree?
Didn’t you used to be someone who meant something to me?
Somebody who meant something to me?
Someone who meant something to me?

Wine, women, and song
I tried them all, it did not take me long
To figure I’d unlocked the door to happiness
I figured wrong
